these are some best practices for web hooks that I think I should account for. What do you think? 

idempotency
backup polling mechanism 
secure with auth tokens to help prevent fuze
use queues for when its high traffic


when the slack message is sent over. Whats the goal with how we want it to be presented. 
should be presented as a bot message and have some sort of tag so you can people on the team can distinguish real messages from bot reminders and updates and stuff. 
Or should I appear as a real message as if that person typed it himself.
